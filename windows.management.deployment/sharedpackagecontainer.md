# Windows.Management.Deployment.SharedPackageContainer

<!--
public sealed class SharedPackageContainer
-->


## -description

Represents a shared package container which groups packages together to run a shared virtual environment where they have access to the same virtual file system, virtual registry, and package files. 

## -remarks

This object is a snapshot view of the shared package container and is not live data. Updating a container definition will not dynamically update an existing **SharedPackageContainer** object. 

Use the [SharedPackageContainerManager](sharedpackagecontainermanager.md) class to create, delete, and manage **SharedPackageContainer** objects.
