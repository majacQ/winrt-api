# Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.ProvisioningAgent

## -description
Represents an agent that provisions connectivity and subscription information with a network provider.

In a desktop app, before using an instance of this class in a way that displays UI, you'll need to associate the object with its owner's window handle. For more info, and code examples, see [Display WinRT UI objects that depend on CoreWindow](/windows/apps/develop/ui-input/display-ui-objects#winui-3-with-c).

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is available only to mobile operator apps and UWP apps given privileged access by mobile network operators.
> 
> If you want to use this API and publish your app to the Microsoft Store, then you'll need special approval. For more information, see the **Restricted capabilities** section in the [App capability declarations](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#restricted-capabilities) topic.
