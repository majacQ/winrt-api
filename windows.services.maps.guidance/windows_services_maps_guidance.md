> The UWP [MapControl](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps/mapcontrol.md) and map services from the [Windows.Services.Maps](windows_services_maps.md) namespaces rely on Bing Maps. Bing Maps for Enterprise is deprecated and will be retired, at which point the MapControl and services will no longer receive data.
