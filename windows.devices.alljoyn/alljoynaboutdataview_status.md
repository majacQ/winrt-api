# Windows.Devices.AllJoyn.AllJoynAboutDataView.Status

## -description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The types in the **Windows.Devices.AllJoyn** namespace are deprecated, and might not be available in future versions of Windows. [AllJoyn](https://openconnectivity.org/technology/reference-implementation/alljoyn/)&mdash;sponsored by AllSeen Alliance&mdash;was an open-source discovery and communication protocol for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios such as turning lights on and off, and reading temperatures. For alternatives, such as [IoTivity Lite](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite) and [IoTivity](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity), refer to the [iotivity.org](https://iotivity.org/) website.

The status returned by the [GetDataBySessionPortAsync](alljoynaboutdataview_getdatabysessionportasync_561097955.md) operation that created the [AllJoynAboutDataView](alljoynaboutdataview.md) object.

## -property-value
The status code.

## -remarks
If the returned value is an error, (i.e. anything other than Ok), it can mean that the other properties arenâ€™t populated, opposed to being populated with actual values that might happen to be empty.
