# Windows.Services.Maps.MapManager

## -description
Displays the UI that lets users download maps for offline use, or update maps that were previously downloaded.

## -remarks
> [!NOTE]
> Offline map downloads stop whenever a [MapControl](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps/mapcontrol.md) is used in any app that's running on the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bing Maps for Enterprise service retirement**
>
> The UWP [MapControl](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps/mapcontrol.md) and map services from the [Windows.Services.Maps](windows_services_maps.md) namespaces rely on Bing Maps. Bing Maps for Enterprise is deprecated and will be retired, at which point the MapControl and services will no longer receive data.
>
> For more information, see the [Bing Maps Developer Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) and [Bing Maps documentation](/bingmaps/getting-started/).

Your app must be authenticated before it can use the [MapControl](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps/mapcontrol.md) and map services in the [Windows.Services.Maps](windows_services_maps.md) namespace. To authenticate your app, you must specify a maps authentication key.

See [Request a maps authentication key](/windows/uwp/maps-and-location/authentication-key).
