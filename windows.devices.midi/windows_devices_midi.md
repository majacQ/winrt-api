# Windows.Devices.Midi

## -description

This namespace provides types for using MIDI devices in a Windows Runtime (WinRT) app.

The types included in this namespace enable you to:

* Enumerate MIDI ports.
* Create a MIDI port object, which opens a stream to the port.
* Send MIDI messages.
* Receive MIDI messages.
* Destroy the MIDI port object, which also closes the stream to the port.

For more info about the MIDI specification, see the [MIDI Association](https://www.midi.org/).

For conceptual documentation, see [MIDI](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/midi). And for a sample app showing how to use these types, see the UWP [MIDI sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/MIDI).
