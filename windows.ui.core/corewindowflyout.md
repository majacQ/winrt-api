# Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindowFlyout

## -description
Defines a child flyout of an app window.

In a desktop app, before using an instance of this class in a way that displays UI, you'll need to associate the object with its owner's window handle. For more info, and code examples, see [Display WinRT UI objects that depend on CoreWindow](/windows/apps/develop/ui-input/display-ui-objects#winui-3-with-c).

## -remarks

<!-- confirmed -->
> [!NOTE]
> This class is not agile, which means that you need to consider its threading model and marshaling behavior. For more info, see [Threading and Marshaling (C++/CX)](/cpp/cppcx/threading-and-marshaling-c-cx).
