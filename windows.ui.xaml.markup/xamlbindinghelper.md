# Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.XamlBindingHelper

## -description
Provides helper methods for data binding.



## -remarks
This class is for use in code that is generated by the XAML compiler.

### XAML attached properties

XamlBindingHelper is the host service class for a [XAML attached property](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/attached-properties-overview). These attached properties enable child elements to report how they should be positioned in their Grid parent.

In order to support XAML processor access to the attached properties, and also to expose equivalent _get_ and _set_ operations to code, each XAML attached property has a pair of Get and Set accessor methods. Another way to get or set the value in code is to use the dependency property system, calling either [GetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_getvalue_1188551207.md) or [SetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_setvalue_52578133.md) and passing the identifier field as the dependency property identifier.

| Attached property | Description |
| - | - |
| [DataTemplateComponent](xamlbindinghelper_datatemplatecomponent.md) | Gets or sets a data template component. |
