# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps

## -description

Defines classes for the Map control. Also defines tile sources and elements that can be placed on a map.

## -remarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bing Maps for Enterprise service retirement**
>
> The UWP [MapControl](mapcontrol.md) and map services from the [Windows.Services.Maps](../windows.services.maps/windows_services_maps.md) namespaces rely on Bing Maps. Bing Maps for Enterprise is deprecated and will be retired, at which point the MapControl and services will no longer receive data.
>
> For more information, see the [Bing Maps Developer Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) and [Bing Maps documentation](/bingmaps/getting-started/).
