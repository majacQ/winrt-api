# Windows.Graphics.Printing.Workflow.PrintWorkflowJobStartingEventArgs.SetSkipSystemRendering

<!--
public void SetSkipSystemRendering ();
-->


## -description

Skips the render filter processing for the current printer job.

## -remarks

If your print support workflow app skips system rendering, the OS will not convert the XPS document into the page description language (PDL) format that is required by the printer. Instead, the XPS generated by the printing application will be directly given to your print support workflow ap, which is then responsible for converting XPS to PDL format.
