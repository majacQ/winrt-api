# Contributing to Windows Runtime (WinRT) API reference

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the API reference content for system Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs. If, alternatively, you want to make updates to *conceptual* topics for this set of APIs, then go to https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-dev-docs.

## Prerequisites

If you want to contribute more than just minor fixes (a line or two), then you'll need to sign a [Microsoft Contribution Licensing Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.microsoft.com/).

If you've already contributed to Microsoft GitHub projects in the past, then you've already completed that step.

## Proposing a change

If you'd like to suggest a change to the docs, then follow these steps:

1. Click **Edit**. You will be redirected to the page's markdown source file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/winrt-api).
2. Modify the file as desired.
3. Use the preview tab to ensure that your changes look good.
4. When you're done, commit your changes, and open a pull request (PR).

After you create the pull request, a member of the Windows docs team will review your changes, and provide any feedback as needed.

**Note:** If you're a Microsoft employee, then don't contribute to this repo. Instead, see [Quickstartâ€”contribute to Windows developer content](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/windows-authoring-guide/quickstart?branch=main).

## Making more substantial changes

To make more substantial changes to an existing topic, or to add or change images, or to contribute a new topic, we recommend that you fork the official repo into your GitHub account, and then create a local clone.

For more info, see [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
