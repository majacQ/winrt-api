# Windows.UI.UIAutomation.Core.CoreAutomationRemoteOperation

<!--
public sealed class CoreAutomationRemoteOperation
-->

## -description

Represents an entry point for UI Automation (UIA) clients to use remote operations.

## -remarks

This class provides the ability to avoid excessive cross-process calls and reduce the overhead of cross-process communication latency.

The remote operation virtual machine accepts a 32-bit unsigned integer (little-endian) representing a bytecode version, followed by a stream of bytecode instructions.

Each bytecode instruction starts with a 32-bit opcode, with multi-byte types encoded using little-endian byte ordering.

The instruction can be followed by a set of parameters, depending on the instruction type. Parameters that refer to objects in an operand register are encoded as 32-bit (little-endian) values, with the relevant operand register referenced by ID. For non-register parameters, see the relevant instruction documentation.

The bytecode accepted by the virtual machine doesnâ€™t expect padding between instructions (the opcode and any subsequent parameters). As such, each instruction has an associated 0-based index, depending on its location in the bytecode stream.
