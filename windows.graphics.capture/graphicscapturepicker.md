## -description

A system picker UI control that allows the customer to select an item on the screen to capture.

In a desktop app, before using an instance of this class in a way that displays UI, you'll need to associate the object with its owner's window handle. For more info, and code examples, see [Display WinRT UI objects that depend on CoreWindow](/windows/apps/develop/ui-input/display-ui-objects#winui-3-with-c).
