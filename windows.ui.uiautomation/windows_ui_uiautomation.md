## -description

Provides support for WinRT automation clients.

## -remarks

Microsoft UI Automation (UIA) is an accessibility framework that enables Windows applications (UIA providers) to expose information about user interfaces (UIs) for consumption by UIA clients. It provides programmatic access to most UI elements on the desktop. It enables assistive technology products, such as screen readers, to provide information about the UI to end users and to manipulate the UI by means other than standard input. UI Automation also allows automated test scripts to interact with the UI.
