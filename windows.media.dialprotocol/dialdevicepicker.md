# Windows.Media.DialProtocol.DialDevicePicker

## -description
Represents a picker flyout that contains a list of remote devices for the user to choose from.

In a desktop app, before using an instance of this class in a way that displays UI, you'll need to associate the object with its owner's window handle. For more info, and code examples, see [Display WinRT UI objects that depend on CoreWindow](/windows/apps/develop/ui-input/display-ui-objects#winui-3-with-c).
